title: The blog deadline

I'm lazy.

So lazy that launching a blog was on my TODO list for a long time now.
There was only one way to finally do it.
I set a deadline.
The deadline is today.
So here is the blog.

In fact making a blog is easy.
Making it open-source is just as well.

What's taking a lot of time is writing (wow it's already been an hour to write the first 2 posts, hope I get better at it).
But the simple fact of having a blog will force me to write more content.

## Here are the easy-to-use tools I used

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because I already use it for my other websites.
It's actually the first time I will be using it for a blog.

I write text in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) because that's just so easy.
And I don't need any special editor.
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is actually pretty good at it.
Sucks for PHP, though.

I host the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/clarkwinkelmann/blog.clarkwinkelmann.com),
because I thing it is logical to share the source and allow contributions.

I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website because, well, it's free,
and you can't choose anything easier when your code is already on GitHub.
They even launched [an update](https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing) yesterday that makes things easier.
Hello `master` branch.

I put [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in front of it just.
GitHub Pages already uses a CDN but I would not look serious if my blog wasn't HTTPS secured.

By the way, maybe you noticed I use the default Jekyll Theme.
If I had decided to create a theme before launching the blog, it would have taken ages !
So I stay with default for the moment. But guess what, *it even looks good*.
